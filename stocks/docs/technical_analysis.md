# Tech Analysis Outline

Outline of the technical analysis that can be performed on the given data, along with the reasons behind each analysis:

### 1. **Moving Averages**

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: To identify the average stock price over a specific period. It smooths out price data and helps identify trends.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices. Useful for identifying short-term trends and reversals.

### 2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

- **RSI Calculation**: Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock. An RSI above 70 indicates overbought conditions, while below 30 indicates oversold conditions.

### 3. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**

- **MACD Calculation**: Shows the relationship between two EMAs (usually 12-day and 26-day). The MACD line crossing above the signal line can indicate a bullish trend, and crossing below can indicate a bearish trend.

### 4. **Bollinger Bands**

- **Bollinger Bands Calculation**: Consists of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations above and below the SMA). Helps to identify volatility and potential overbought/oversold conditions.

### 5. **Volume Analysis**

- **Volume Moving Average**: To analyze average trading volumes over a period (e.g., 10 days, 50 days). Helps in understanding the strength of a price move.
- **Volume Spikes**: Significant increases in volume can indicate a strong interest in the stock, potentially signaling a breakout or reversal.

### 6. **Support and Resistance Levels**

- **Support Levels**: Historical price levels where a stock tends to find buying interest.
- **Resistance Levels**: Historical price levels where a stock tends to find selling interest.

### 7. **Trend Analysis**

- **Trend Lines**: Drawing trend lines to identify the direction of the stock's price movement.
- **Trend Channels**: Identifying upward or downward channels to understand the range within which the stock is moving.

### 8. **Candlestick Patterns**

- **Candlestick Pattern Recognition**: Analyzing candlestick patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, engulfing) to predict potential reversals or continuations.

### 9. **Fibonacci Retracement**

- **Fibonacci Levels**: Identifying potential reversal levels by calculating Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).

### 10. **Beta Analysis**

- **Beta Calculation**: Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Helps in understanding the stock's risk compared to the overall market.

### 11. **Sector Analysis**

- **Comparing Performance within the Sector**: Analyzing how a stock performs relative to its sector can provide insights into its relative strength and weakness.

### 12. **Correlation Analysis**

- **Stock Correlation**: Analyzing the correlation between different stocks to understand diversification benefits or potential risks.

### 13. **Dividend Analysis**

- **Dividend Yield**: Calculating the dividend yield to understand the income potential of the stock.
- **Dividend Growth**: Analyzing the historical growth of dividends to evaluate the sustainability and growth prospects.

### 14. **Financial Ratios**

- **P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio**: Evaluating valuation metrics to compare the stock with its peers or historical averages.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Assessing the financial leverage and risk.

### 15. **Growth Analysis**

- **Earnings Growth**: Analyzing the earnings growth to understand the companyâ€™s profitability trend.
- **Revenue Growth**: Evaluating the revenue growth to assess the company's sales performance.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data for each stock using a financial API (e.g., yfinance).
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Implementation**: Write Python code to calculate each of the outlined analyses.
4. **Visualization**: Use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize the results.

# Support and Resistance

In technical analysis, the concepts of support and resistance are crucial for understanding price movements in financial markets.

### Support

- **Definition**: Support is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand. As the price drops, buyers become more inclined to buy and sellers become less inclined to sell.
- **Significance**:
  - **Price Floor**: Acts as a price floor preventing the asset from falling further.
  - **Entry Point**: Traders might look to enter long positions at support levels.
  - **Breakdown Indicator**: If the price falls below support, it can indicate a bearish signal, often leading to a further decline.

### Resistance

- **Definition**: Resistance is a price level where an uptrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of supply. As the price rises, sellers become more inclined to sell and buyers become less inclined to buy.
- **Significance**:
  - **Price Ceiling**: Acts as a price ceiling preventing the asset from rising further.
  - **Exit Point**: Traders might look to exit long positions or enter short positions at resistance levels.
  - **Breakout Indicator**: If the price rises above resistance, it can indicate a bullish signal, often leading to further gains.

### Example

Consider a stock trading between $50 and $60:

- **Support Level**: $50
  - Whenever the stock price falls to $50, it finds support because buyers step in to purchase at this price, preventing it from falling further.
- **Resistance Level**: $60
  - Whenever the stock price rises to $60, it encounters resistance because sellers step in to sell at this price, preventing it from rising further.

### Visual Representation

- **Support Level**:
  - Price repeatedly bounces off a certain lower price.
- **Resistance Level**:
  - Price repeatedly halts at a certain higher price.

### Practical Use

1. **Trading Strategies**: Traders use support and resistance levels to make trading decisions.
2. **Risk Management**: Helps in setting stop-loss orders just below support or just above resistance to manage risk.

### Analytical Coding Implementation

To identify these levels programmatically:

- **Support**: Identify the lowest price points over a given period.
- **Resistance**: Identify the highest price points over a given period.

### Example in Code

Using the earlier class `SupportResistance` to calculate and mark support and resistance levels in a DataFrame:

```python
class SupportResistance:
    def __init__(self, stock_data):
        self.stock_data = stock_data

    def calculate_support_resistance(self, window=20):
        for ticker, df in self.stock_data.items():
            df["Support"] = df["Close"].rolling(window=window).min()
            df["Resistance"] = df["Close"].rolling(window=window).max()
```

In the above code:

- **Support**: `df["Close"].rolling(window=20).min()` calculates the minimum closing price over the last 20 days, representing the support level.
- **Resistance**: `df["Close"].rolling(window=20).max()` calculates the maximum closing price over the last 20 days, representing the resistance level.

### Conclusion

Understanding and identifying support and resistance levels are fundamental skills in technical analysis, providing traders with critical information on potential entry and exit points, as well as helping in managing risk.
